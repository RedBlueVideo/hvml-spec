(Formerly known as “OVML” for Open Video Markup Language)

HVML is an RDFa-compatible, XML-based markup language for codifying information pertaining to audio-visual media such as films, television, home movies, or any other moving image, digital or analog.

Its primary goal is to provide a standardized syntax and interface for storing and querying video metadata. The type of data it encodes is comparable to those found on [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/), [TMDb](http://www.themoviedb.org/), [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/), and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/), however it is not meant to replace these services; in theory they could all implement HVML.

It is a similar technology to [MPEG-7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-7), but more limited in scope (to make it easier for humans to understand and author), with the goal of being [free](https://github.com/RedBlueVideo/hvml-spec/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) of [patent encumbrance](http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/2196421/Licensing+Firm+Preps+for+MPEG7+Standard.htm).

Inspired by the article [“How The Television Will Be Revolutionized: The Exciting Future of the iPad, Internet TV, and Web 3.0”](http://www.accelerating.org/articles/televisionwillberevolutionized.html), which talks about an “OVML”, its uses cases do not coincide 100% with the ones the author mentions.
